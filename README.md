# Documentation: Building a Web Server with Actix in Rust for Node.js Developers

This tutorial is designed for Node.js developers who are interested in learning how to create a web server using Rust and Actix-web. We'll go through the process step-by-step, comparing the Rust code with equivalent Node.js code to make the transition smoother.

## Introduction

Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes safety, speed, and concurrency. Actix-web is a high-performance web framework for Rust, enabling developers to create robust web applications. This tutorial is tailored for Node.js developers who are interested in transitioning to Rust, providing a step-by-step guide to creating a web server using Actix-web while comparing it with similar implementations in Node.js.

## Prerequisites

- **Basic knowledge of Rust** syntax and concepts.
- **Rust installed on your system** If not, download it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
- **Familiarity with Node.js and Express.js.**

## Project Setup

To begin, you need to create a new Rust project using Cargo, Rust’s package manager and build system. Open your terminal and run:

```
  cargo new actix-web-server
  cd actix-web-server
```

This command will create a new directory named ```actix-web-server``` with the following structure:

```
  actix-web-server
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
```

## Adding Dependencies

Next, you will need to add some dependencies to your project. Open the Cargo.toml file and add the following lines under the [dependencies] section:

```
  [dependencies]
  actix-web = "4"
  serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
  serde_json = "1.0"
  env_logger = "0.9"
```

## Explanation of Dependencies
 - **actix-web**: This is the web framework that will handle HTTP requests and responses.
 - **serde and serde_json**: These libraries are used for serializing and deserializing data structures into and from JSON.
 - **env_logger**: A logging framework that integrates well with Actix’s middleware, helping you log HTTP requests and responses.
